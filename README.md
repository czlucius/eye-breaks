## What is this app about?
Eye Break is an Android app that schedules eye breaks after periodic intervals that can be set in the app user interface(e.g. use for 20 min), blocking the screen with a full screen dialog for a set amount of time. During the duration of the eye break, the user is not allowed to interact with other apps, unless he/she skips the break. It helps the user to rest his/her eyes.
